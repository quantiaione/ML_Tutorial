# ML Tutorial 1: Classification

Classification is one of the most widely encountered problems in machine learning with various industrial applications, from fraud detection, medical diagnosis, face recognition, Youtube video categorization, to text classification, hate speech detection on Twitter.

I will use a classification problem to illustrate the approach.

The problem at hand:

” One of the biggest challenges of an auto dealership purchasing a used car at an auto auction is the risk of that the vehicle might have serious issues that prevent it from being sold to customers. The auto community calls these unfortunate purchases “kicks”.

Modelers who can figure out which cars have a higher risk of being kick can provide real value to dealerships trying to provide the best inventory selection possible to their customers.

The challenge of this competition is to predict if the car purchased at the Auction is a Kick (bad buy). “

Here is the typical analysis plan for the classification problem.

1. EDA.
2. Data Prep with 4 C’s — Correcting, Completing, Creating, and Converting.
3. MLA ( Machine Learning Algorithms) Comparison and selection.
4. Obtain the predictions from the selected algorithms.
5. Optimization of the selected algorithms.

I have uploaded the analysis notebook which you may check it out here. In this notebook, I only cover the first four steps.
